Issues:

- Review MPI_Waitall and wrapping array of statuses in Fortran to C.
- Verify that Integer*8 is a long long int.
- Just permanently transform the headless source to run with YogiMPI.  We can add
  some CMake Fortran-transform macros in the next couple of weeks.

Next Steps:

- Try building and running Fortran tests.
- Make some C and Fortran tests for Gather, Scatter, and creating datatypes.
- Try compiling and running plib tests.
- Try compiling and running headless KCFD.
- Try compiling and running headless KCFD with another YogiMPI built with another MPI distribution.
