Issues:

- Just permanently transform the headless source to run with YogiMPI.  We can add
  some CMake Fortran-transform macros in the next couple of weeks.

Next Steps:

- Try compiling and running plib tests.
- Try compiling and running headless KCFD.
- Try compiling and running headless KCFD with another YogiMPI built with another MPI distribution.
