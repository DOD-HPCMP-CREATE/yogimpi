YogiMPI Overview
================

* Prerequisites *
  - Intel or GNU (4.8+) C, C++, and Fortran compiler
  - MPI distribution with compiler wrappers (e.g. mpicc, mpicxx, mpif90)
  - (Optional) ptoolsrte-0.5.1 and above for Python support

* Installation *
  - Load your compilers and MPI wrappers into the path and runtime library path.
  - Set the environment variable YCC, YCXX, and YF90 to point to your serial
    compilers.
  - Set the environment variable YMPICC to point to your MPI's C compiler
    wrapper. 
  - Optionally load ptoolsrte-0.5.1 through a source file or module and set the
    environment variable YMPI_ENABLE_PYTHON to 1.  This step is only required by
    CREATE AV developers - end users don't have to do this. 
  - Once set, run ./configure -i /path/to/install
  - To build, type "make," and then "make install" to copy files to the
    installation directory.

* Testing *
  - A small set of C and Fortran tests ship with YogiMPI to ensure that basic
    functionality works as expected.  This is *not* a comprehensive test suite
    but a small subset of commonly used MPI routines.
  - After "make" and "make install" (the installation *must* run), change into
    the test subdirectory.
  - "make runtest" will build and execute all tests.  If successful, a message
    will be printed.

* Modules and Source Files *
  - As part of the installation, module files and bash/csh scripts are provided
    in /path/to/install/etc.  These can be used to add YogiMPI to the PATH and
    [DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
